# Cross-Platform Application Development with OpenCV 4 and Qt 5 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Cross-Platform Application Development with OpenCV 4 and Qt 5 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/cross-platform-application-development-opencv-4-and-qt-5-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788479080), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
OpenCV is the most popular library for building computer vision applications. Qt is a C++ IDE used to create GUI applications with ease. The main benefit of using Qt is that we can integrate OpenCV GUIs of GUIs created with Qt. Follow along with instructor Antonio Ortiz to build cross-platform applications using Qt.
In this course, you will learn to combine the power of OpenCV and Qt. First, you will start by grabbing some images and videos to show them in QML. Antonio also shows you how to calibrate an array of two stereo cameras. You will learn to deploy your application on both Linux and Android platforms.
By the end of this course, you will have become better at developing OpenCV applications, especially with Qt.
